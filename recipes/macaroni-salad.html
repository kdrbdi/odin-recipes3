    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Macaroni Salad with Pickles is a creamy, tangy side dish perfect for picnics, barbecues, or everyday meals. It features tender elbow macaroni mixed with crunchy diced pickles, finely chopped red onions, and celery for extra texture. The dressing is typically made from mayonnaise, a touch of mustard, and pickle juice, creating a rich and zesty flavor that ties everything together.</p>
    <p>This salad is easy to customize with add-ins like hard-boiled eggs, shredded cheese, or even diced ham. After mixing, it’s best chilled for at least an hour to allow the flavors to meld. The combination of creamy and crunchy elements, along with the punchy pickle tang, makes it a crowd-pleasing favorite.</p>
